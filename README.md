# ZKM - Writing the History of the Future - Logo Redesign 

## Concept

***Writing the History of the Future*** is an art exhibition from the ZKM | Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe. 

The idea with this project is to come up with an alternative logo for this exhibition. While creating a new visual identity from scratch, it is important that the new logo still embodies the ideas and represent this unique cultural institution that is the ZKM. Considering that the ZKM is the "MECCA OF MEDIA ARTS" we took inspirations from a very broad range of past and present concepts from the media culture.
